## General Information

### Project Overview

This is a **Simple Password Generator** built with **TypeScript** and **React**. The application allows users to generate secure and random passwords with a customizable length and character set. The user interface is animated and interactive, built using **Framer Motion** for smooth transitions and animations.

The app enables users to:
- Choose the length of the password.
- Select which types of characters to include (e.g., lowercase, uppercase, numbers, symbols).
- Generate a random password based on the selected criteria.
- Copy the generated password to the clipboard.
